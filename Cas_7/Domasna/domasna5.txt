1. How many times is a number contained in an array

Write a function named findNumber that:
Takes 2 arguments: number, array
Calculates how many times the number is contained in an array with numbers
Outputs the result to the screen like so: "There is 4 occurrences of number 5 in the array"
Call the function three times with different arrays.

2. Try to write a function that finds factorial of a number. You must use recursion. Example for factorial: factorial of 5 is 5*4*3*2*1 = 120,
 factorial of 3 is 3*2*1 = 6, factorial of 1 is 1.

3. Create an array of five first names and an array of five last names. Create a new array that will have same number of elements as the
other two arrays, but the elements will be fullnames. Use for loop and a function to create a full name, where the first argument will be
the first name (from the first array) and the second argument will be last name( from the second array). The function will return full name.
Print all the full names with higher order function forEach().
